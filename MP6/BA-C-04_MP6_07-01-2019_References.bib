abstract = "For three different metal-metalloid glasses and one metal-metal glass, it is demonstrated, using the so-called shift-effect, that the total radial distribution functions, measured by either X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction, are all accurately reproduced by the same set of partial RDFs. The shift-effect, which has been experimentally shown to be true for Ni81B19, assumes that all partial RDFs are essentially identical, apart from an effective atomic diameter as the only scaling factor. Calculated and experimental RDFs are compared for amorphous FeMnBSi, FeNiP, PdNiP and TiNi. The atomic diameters that yield the best fits fall well within the ranges found for the same atoms in crystalline and amorphous metals of other compositions. Only when the RDF peak positions and peak heights are subjected to a very sensitive test, small composition-dependent discrepancies are detected. These are similar to those found in other investigations between the experimental partial RDFs for Ni81B19 and Fe80B20."
